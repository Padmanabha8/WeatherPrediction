# WeatherPrediction
Dataset from Kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/budincsevity/szeged-weather
Wanted to choose a dataset which has more number of columns. This included 12 different categories which gave wide range of possiblities to test on a dataset. And also it is in hourly format.
Using LSTM Model, predicted the future five(5) hours based on the temperature of last thirty hours(30).
LSTM being a Deep Learning model was quite fun to execute but tiresome whereas, the basic Machine Learning models produced outputs based on the given data.
Totally implemented five models on the dataset to observe the difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.
